This tutorial introduces the nitty gritties of plotting 2D and 3D data on Geographical Maps by using Matplotlib Basemap toolkit. As part of the term project for Applied Machine Learning course at McGill University in Fall 2016, we were given the task of predicting various behaviours of animal movement aimed at conservation of the species. The data is in the form of time series and can be otained at movebank, which is a repository of animal tracking data accumulated from various scientific studies. My team had chosen to analyze the migratory behaviour of Lesser Black-backed Gulls birds. The reference paper and the data can be found here.
This is the first notebook which I have created to walk you through the project. In this notebook, I will get you accustomed to the data and concentrate on plotting the data on a world map. In the posts to follow some data cleansing will be done, we will see in detail what movebank has to offer to the machine learning community in terms of data and literature. I will then briefly talk about the problems we had tackled. We will then walk through some unsupervised learning algorithms and subsequently delve into deeper models.
Before starting with the making pretty plots, take note of some important links:
You can find the project report, code and any addiotnal links in my git repository.
I stumbled upon a very sexy library plot.ly which makes visualizations easier for data scientists.
This blog post on Kaggle helped me with the plots and should serve the same purpose to you.
Appropriate credits should be given to my teammates: Chris and Vincent
